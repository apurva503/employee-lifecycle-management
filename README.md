ðŸ§¾ **Project Overview**

This system manages the employee lifecycle using a Kafka-based microservices architecture.
It includes the following services:
  **EmployeeService**: Handles employee creation, updates, and status changes.
  **HcmService**: Manages human capital management (HCM) data.
  **PromotionService**: Evaluates promotion eligibility based on HCM events.

Kafka is used for asynchronous event-driven communication between services.
